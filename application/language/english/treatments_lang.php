$lang['treatments_text_1']='There is currently no “cure” for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, a range of specialist education and behavioural programmes (often referred to as interventions) can be effective in improving the skills of children with ASD.';
$lang['treatments_text_2']='Some researchers group treatments for ASD into different categories (see figure below). Each category focuses on a type of treatment or on a specific set of symptoms and behaviors that it tries to help.';
$lang['treatments_text_3']='Because every child with an ASD may show different types of symptoms, a family may need to choose from the available treatments,therapies, and programs based on the child’s needs. The treatment plan for your child may have some of each of these treatment categories.';
$lang['treatments_text_4']='These programs address social skills, attention,sleep, play, anxiety, parent interaction,challenging behaviors, and other activities. “Early intensive behavioral intervention”programs use specially trained clinicians who work with parents and young children for up to 25 hours every week. Early intensive behavioral intervention programs can last as long as 12 weeks to 3 years.';

$lang['treatments_text_10']='Occupational therapy is often used as a treatment for the sensory integration issues associated with ASDs. It is also used to help teach life skills that involve fine-motor movements, such as dressing, using utensils, cutting with scissors, and writing. OT works to improve the individual’s quality of life and ability to participate fully in daily activities. Each occupational therapy program is based on individual evaluations and goals.';
$lang['treatments_text_11']='Physical therapy is used to improve gross motor skills and handle sensory integration issues, particularly those involving the individual’s ability to feel and be aware of his body in space. Similar to OT, physical therapy is used to improve the individual’s ability to participate in everyday activities. PT works to teach and improve skills such as walking, sitting, coordination, and balance. Physical therapy is most effective when integrated in an early intervention program.';
